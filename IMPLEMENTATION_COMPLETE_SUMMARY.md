#### 2. Update Legal Documents (30 minutes)
Open both `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and `TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`

Replace:
- `[Current Date]` → Today's date

- `[Your State/Country]` → For governing law

#### 3. Host Legal Documents (15 minutes)

**Option A: GitHub Pages (Free & Easy)**
```bash
1. Create repo: github.com/[you]/synapse-legal
2. Upload PRIVACY_POLICY.md and TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md
3. Enable Pages in Settings
4. URLs will be:
   - https://[you].github.io/synapse-legal/PRIVACY_POLICY
   - https://[you].github.io/synapse-legal/TERMS_OF_SERVICE
```

**Option B: Netlify (Even Easier)**
```bash
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag & drop your .md files
3. Get instant HTTPS URL
4. Free forever
```

#### 4. Add Delete Account Button to Profile (10 minutes)

You need to add a button somewhere in the profile section:

```swift
Button("Delete Account") {
    // Show DeleteAccountView()
}
```

I can help you add this if you tell me where you want it!
